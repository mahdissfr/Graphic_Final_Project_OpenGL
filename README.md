The output of this project is a software with the ability to simulate a 3-dimensional space in which the camera moves like a ghost on the screen and can interact with 3-dimensional objects in space and add new objects to the space.
In this project, a number of primitive 3D objects including a cube, a pyramid and a prism have been implemented. The program must be able to place or change the situation of any of these objects in a 3D dimension by rotation, scale, and position.

The project introduction is attached.
